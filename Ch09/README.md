# Chapter 8 - Kotlin

## `Ch08/*.kts`

This directory contains Kotlin script files (`*.kts`) demonstrating most of the
snippets of Kotlin shown through the chapter.

These snippets may be loaded in an IDE and run individually. They may be run at
the command-line directly as follows:

```
kotlin Expressions.kts
```

# `Ch08/coroutine-app` and `Ch08/interoperability`

These directories each contain a full example application in Kotlin.

* `Ch08/coroutine-app` - Basic co-routines usage
* `Ch08/interoperatbility` - Kotlin + Java interoperatbility

The projects use Gradle and may be loaded in an IDE or built on the
command-line:

```
./gradlew run
```
